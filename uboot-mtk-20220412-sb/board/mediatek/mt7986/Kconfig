      Select this if you want to use bad block management to handle
      bad blocks marked druing factory production, and to handle new
      bad blocks during use.
      Enabling this option will create a MTD translation layer on
      the original MTD of the NAND device.

      This option determines how many blocks at the high adress of NAND
      can be used for NMBM. For a large size NAND, 1/16 of total blocks
      are still too large for NMBM. For this situation please set
      CONFIG_NMBM_MAX_BLOCKS to a proper value to limit the maximum
      reserved blocks.

      This option is applied after NMBM_MAX_RATIO to ensure maximum
      blocks reserved block for NMBM will not exceed the value set by
      this option.

	  This is intended for using UBI built on the top of MTD devices.
	  Generally you should select this instead of SPI-NAND for new design
	  in order to extend the lifecycle of NAND devices.
